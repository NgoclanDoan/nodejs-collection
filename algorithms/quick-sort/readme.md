The algorithms can be broken down into three main steps

1. Choose a pivot element from array.
2. Partition the array into two subarrays, one containing elements smaller than the pivot, and the other containing elements larger than the pivot.
3. Recursively apply the quick sort algorithm to the 2 subarrays until the entire array is sorted.
